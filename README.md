📊 Sales Analysis Interactive Dashboard (2020–2023)
Project Overview

This project is an interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI, supported by Excel (2020–2023 sales data) and Python for data analysis and visualization.
The dashboard is designed as one unified report with multiple pages, all focused on analyzing sales performance and related operational insights.
The goal of this project is to transform raw sales data into clear, actionable insights that help understand business performance, trends, and areas for improvement.

📂 Data Sources
Excel File (Sales 2020–2023)
Contains sales transactions, customers, products, OEMs, territories, stock, orders, and payment details.

Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and additional visualizations to support insights.

Power BI
Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard creation.
🎛️ Interactivity
The dashboard is built using a well-structured data model and custom DAX measures to calculate key metrics such as total sales, total profit, profit margin, and time-based measures like MTD, QTD, and YTD. Interactive slicers (dropdown filters) are available across all pages, allowing users to dynamically analyze data by date, customer, product type, OEM, territory, and salesperson. Additionally, tooltips are used to provide detailed contextual insights when hovering over visuals, enhancing user understanding without cluttering the dashboard. These features together make the dashboard highly interactive, intuitive, and user-friendly, supporting efficient data exploration and decision-making.
